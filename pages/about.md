Hello! Welcome to our little corner of the Internet! We are the Weller Family.

Orion and I are both currently students at BYU. He studies computer science and statistics while I study family life. We both do research in our respective fields and dinner topics usually revolve around our studies.

We love spending time together whether it be in the gym, Rockwell Ice Cream, or at home watching one of our favorite shows (Currently watching: The Good Wife). One of our favorite ways to spend time together is traveling. In our first year of marriage, we visited four countries: Canada, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil. We also have recently taken up conquering the many National Parks that surround us.

We are total planners at heart and if you asked us what our five year plan was, we'd probably give you at least five potential plans we've concocted. One of my plans that has been in place for years is to share things I've learned about relationships with an wider social audience. Essentially I am Hitch in female form (Please tell me you've seen that movie...) And I am so excited to share everything that I know with you to enrich your relationships with family, friends, and even that special someone.
